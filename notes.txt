SOME CODE FOR MULTIPROCESSING IF YOU NEED IT:

from multiprocessing import Pool
import yourFunctionDefs

numProcesses = 3 # or however many you need

p = Pool(processes=numProcesses)
results = []

for i in range(numProcesses):
    res = p.apply_async(yourFunctionDefs.yourFunc, (arg_a, arg_b, etc, i)) # call your training function with your arguments
    results.append(res)
    print("started getting result for", i)

for j, res in enumerate(results):
    result = res.get() # get results asynchronously
    print("got result", result)

p.close()
